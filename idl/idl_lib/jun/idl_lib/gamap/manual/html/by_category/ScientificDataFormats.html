 NAME:
        BPCH2COARDS

 PURPOSE:
        Reads data from a binary punch file and saves it in a
        COARDS-compliant netCDF (network Common Data Format) file.

        NOTE: COARDS is a formatting standard for netCDF files which
        is widely used in both the atmospheric & climate communities.
        COARDS-compliant netCDF files can be read by GAMAP, GrADS and
        other plotting packages.
        
        See http://ferret.wrc.noaa.gov/noaa_coop/coop_cdf_profile.html
        for more information about the COARDS standard.

 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O, BPCH Format, Scientific Data Formats

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        BPCH2COARDS, INFILE, OUTFILE [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        INFILE -> Name of the binary punch file to read.  If INFILE
             is not passed, the user will be prompted to supply a 
             file name via a dialog box.

        OUTFILE -> Name of the netCDF file to be written.  It is
             recommended to insert the tokens %DATE% (or %date%)
             into OUTFILE, since BPCH2COARDS will write a separate
             netCDF file for each unique YYYYMMDD value contained
             within the *.bpch file.  If OUTFILE is not specified,
             BPCH2COARDS will use the default file name 
             "coards.%DATE%.nc".

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        DIAGN -> Array of diagnostic categories from the bpch file
             to save to netCDF format.  If omitted, BPCH2COARDS will 
             save all diagnostic categories.  
 
        /VERBOSE -> If set, will print the name of each tracer
             as it is being written to the netCDF file.  Useful
             for debugging purposes.

        _EXTRA=e -> Picks up additional keywords for NCDF_SET

 OUTPUTS:
        None

 SUBROUTINES:
        External Subroutines Required:
        ============================================
        CTM_GET_DATA        TAU2YYMMDD    (function)  
        UNDEFINE            REPLACE_TOKEN (function)
        STRREPL (function)  GETMODELANDGRIDINFO
    
 REQUIREMENTS:
        (1) References routines from GAMAP and TOOLS packages.
        (2) You must use a version of IDL containing the NCDF routines.

 NOTES:
        (1) BPCH2COARDS assumes that each data block in the *.bpch
            file is either 2-D (lon-lat) or 3-D (lon-lat-alt). 

        (2) BPCH2COARDS assumes that the number type of each data 
            block in the *.bpch file is REAL*4 (a.k.a. FLOAT). 

        (3) BPCH2COARDS assumes that all data blocks in the *.bpch
            file adhere to same horizontal grid.  This will always
            be true for output files from the GEOS-CHEM model.

        (4) BPCH2COARDS will write a separate COARDS-compliant netCDF
            file corresponding to each unique YYYYMMDD date.  This 
            prevents the files from becoming too large to be read
            with IDL.

        (5) BPCH2COARDS will replace the %DATE% (or %date%) token with
            the current YYYYMMDD value.  Therefore, it is recommended
            to insert this token into the string passed via OUTFILE.

        (6) BPCH2COARDS will write arrays containing the latitudes,
            longitudes to the netCDF file.  For 3-D data blocks,
            the eta or sigma centers will also be written to the
            file.  Time will be written as TAU values (i.e. hours
            since 00:00 GMT on 01-Jan-1985.

        (7) The netCDF library has apparently been updated in 
            IDL 6.0+.  The result is that variable names containing
            characters such as '$', '=', and ':' may now cause an
            error in NCDF_VARDEF.  Therefore, we now pre-screen 
            tracer names with function NCDF_VALID_NAME.
           
 EXAMPLE:
        BPCH2COARDS, 'myfile.bpch', 'myfile.%DATE%.nc'

            ; Will write the contents of "myfile.bpch" to one
            ; or more COARDS-compliant netCDF files adhering
            ; to the filename convention "myfile.YYYYMMDD.nc"

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:
  rjp & bmy, 17 Mar 2005: GAMAP VERSION 2.03
                          - Based on bpch2nc.pro
        bmy, 21 Jul 2005: GAMAP VERSION 2.04
                          - Bug fix: 
        bmy, 13 Jul 2006: GAMAP VERSION 2.05
                          - Remove call to PTR_FREE
  bmy & phs, 13 Jul 2007: GAMAP VERSION 2.10
                          - Now count GCAP among the GEOS family
                            for the purpose of converting the TAU
                            date to a YYYY/MM/DD date.

 NAME:
        BPCH2GMI

 PURPOSE:
        Reads data from a binary punch file and saves it in
        netCDF (network Common Data Format) format.  The data
        will be shifted so that the first longitude is 0 degrees
        (i.e. the prime meridian) in order to conform with the
        GMI (Global Model Initiative) model grid definition.

 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O, BPCH Format, Scientific Data Formats

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        BPCH2GMI, INFILE, OUTFILE [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        INFILE -> Name of the binary punch file to read.  If
             INFILE is not passed, the user will be prompted
             to supply a file name via a dialog box.

        OUTFILE -> Name of the netCDF file to be written.  It is
             recommended to insert the tokens %DATE% and %TIME%
             into OUTFILE, since BPCH2NC will write a separate
             netCDF file for each time index in the *.bpch file.
             The tokens %DATE% and %TIME% will be overwritten 
             with the current values of YYYYMMDD and HHMMSS.
             Default is "bpch2nc_output.%DATE%.%TIME%.nc".

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        DIAGN -> A diagnostic category name (e.g. "IJ-AVG-$") or
             array of names which will restrict the data block 
             selection.  If DIAGN is omitted, then all data blocks 
             within INFILE will be saved in netCDF format to OUTFILE.
 
        /VERBOSE -> If set, will print the names of each tracer
             as it is being written to the netCDF file.

        _EXTRA=e -> Picks up additional keywords for netCDF routines

 OUTPUTS:

 SUBROUTINES:
        Internal Subroutines:
        ============================================
        B2G_Valid_VarName (function)
        B2G_SetNcDim      (function)
        B2G_GetNcDim      (function)

        External Subroutines Required:
        ============================================
        CTM_GET_DATA        TAU2YYMMDD    (function)  
        UNDEFINE            REPLACE_TOKEN (function)
        STRREPL (function)  GETMODELANDGRIDINFO
    
 REQUIREMENTS:
        (1) References routines from GAMAP and TOOLS packages.
        (2) You must use a version of IDL containing the NCDF routines.

 NOTES:
        (1) BPCH2GMI assumes that each data block in the *.bpch file
            is either 2-D (lon-lat) or 3-D (lon-lat-alt). 

        (2) BPCH2GMI assumes that the number type of each data block
            in the *.bpch file is REAL*4 (a.k.a. FLOAT). 

        (3) BPCH2GMI assumes that all data blocks in the *.bpch file
            file adhere to same horizontal grid.  This will always
            be true for output files from the GEOS-CHEM model.

        (4) BPCH2GMI will write a separate NC file corresponding
            to each time index in the *.bpch file.  This prevents
            file sizes from getting large, especially if there is
            a lot of diagnostic output in the *.bpch file.

        (5) BPCH2GMI will replace the %DATE% token with the 
            current YYYYMMDD value, and will replace the %TIME%
            token with the current HHMMSS value.  Therefore, it
            is recommended to insert these tokens into the string
            passed via OUTFILE.  The tokens %DATE% and %TIME% tokens 
            may also be passed in lowercase (e.g,  %date%, %time% ).  

        (6) BPCH2GMI will write arrays containing the latitudes,
            longitudes to the netCDF file.  For 3-D data blocks,
            the sigma centers will also be written to the file.  
            Date and time are stored as global attributes.

        (7) The netCDF library has apparently been updated in 
            IDL 6.0+.  The result is that variable names containing
            characters such as '$', '=', and ':' may now cause an
            error in NCDF_VARDEF.  Therefore, we now pre-screen 
            tracer names with function NCDF_VALID_NAME.
           
 EXAMPLE:
        BPCH2GMI, 'myfile.bpch', 'myfile.%DATE%.%TIME%.nc'

            ; Will write the contents of "myfile.bpch" to one
            ; or more netCDF files "myfile.YYYYMMDD.HHMMSS.nc"

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:
  bmy & phs, 20 Aug 2007: GAMAP VERSION 2.10
                          - Based on BPCH2NC
        bmy, 19 Dec 2007: GAMAP VERSION 2.12
                          - Now save sigma edges & centers or
                            eta edges & centers to the file.
                          - Extra error trap, if there is only one
                            level in the file then set IS_3D=0.

 NAME:
        BPCH2HDF

 PURPOSE:
        Reads data from a binary punch file and saves it in HDF-SD 
        (Hierarchical Data Format, Scientific Dataset) format.

 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O, BPCH Format, Scientific Data Formats

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        BPCH2HDF, INFILE, OUTFILE [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        INFILE -> Name of the binary punch file to read.  If
             INFILE is not passed, the user will be prompted
             to supply a file name via a dialog box.

        OUTFILE -> Name of the HDF file to be written.  It is
             recommended to insert the tokens %DATE% and %TIME%
             into OUTFILE, since BPCH2HDF will write a separate
             HDF file for each time index in the *.bpch file.
             The tokens %DATE% and %TIME% will be overwritten 
             with the current values of YYYYMMDD and HHMMSS.
             Default is "bpch2hdf_output.%DATE%.%TIME%.hdf".

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        DIAGN -> A diagnostic category name (e.g. "IJ-AVG-$") or
              array of names which will restrict the data block 
              selection.  If DIAGN is omitted, then all data blocks 
              within INFILE will be saved in HDF format to OUTFILE.

        _EXTRA=e -> Picks up additional keywords for HDF_SETSD

 OUTPUTS:

 SUBROUTINES:
        External Subroutines Required:
        =========================================
        CTM_GET_DATA    TAU2YYMMDD    (function)  
        UNDEFINE        REPLACE_TOKEN (function)
        HDF_SETSD       GETMODELANDGRIDINFO

 REQUIREMENTS:
        (1) References routines from GAMAP and TOOLS packages.
        (2) You must use a version of IDL containing the HDF-SD routines.

 NOTES:
        (1) BPCH2HDF assumes that each data block in the *.bpch file
            is either 2-D (lon-lat) or 3-D (lon-lat-alt).  

        (2) BPCH2HDF assumes that all data blocks in the *.bpch file
            file adhere to same horizontal grid.  This will be true
            for output files from the GEOS-CHEM model.

        (3) BPCH2HDF will write a separate HDF file corresponding
            to each time index in the *.bpch file.  This prevents
            file sizes from getting large, especially if there is
            a lot of diagnostic output in the *.bpch file.

        (4) BPCH2HDF will replace the %DATE% token with the 
            current YYYYMMDD value, and will replace the %TIME%
            token with the current HHMMSS value.  Therefore, it
            is recommended to insert these tokens into the string
            passed via OUTFILE.  These tokens may be in either
            uppercase or lowercase.

        (4) BPCH2HDF will also write arrays containing the latitudes,
            longitudes, sigma coordinates (for 3-D data blocks only!)
            to the HDF file.

        (5) BPCH2HDF will write arrays containing the latitudes,
            longitudes to the netCDF file.  For 3-D data blocks,
            the sigma centers and sigma edges will also be written 
            to the file.

 EXAMPLE:
        BPCH2HDF, 'myfile.bpch', 'myfile.%DATE%.%TIME%.hdf'

            ; Will write the contents of "myfile.bpch" to
            ; one or more HDF files "myfile.YYYYMMDD.HHMMSS.hdf"

        netCDF (network Common Data Format) format.

 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O, BPCH Format, Scientific Data Formats

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        BPCH2NC, INFILE, OUTFILE [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        INFILE -> Name of the binary punch file to read.  If
             INFILE is not passed, the user will be prompted
             to supply a file name via a dialog box.

        OUTFILE -> Name of the netCDF file to be written.  It is
             recommended to insert the tokens %DATE% and %TIME%
             into OUTFILE, since BPCH2NC will write a separate
             netCDF file for each time index in the *.bpch file.
             The tokens %DATE% and %TIME% will be overwritten 
             with the current values of YYYYMMDD and HHMMSS.
             Default is "bpch2nc_output.%DATE%.%TIME%.nc".

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        DIAGN -> A diagnostic category name (e.g. "IJ-AVG-$") or
              array of names which will restrict the data block 
              selection.  If DIAGN is omitted, then all data blocks 
              within INFILE will be saved in netCDF format to OUTFILE.
 
        /VERBOSE -> If set, will print the names of each tracer
             as it is being written to the netCDF file.

        _EXTRA=e -> Picks up additional keywords for NCDF_SET

 OUTPUTS:

 SUBROUTINES:
        Internal Subroutines:
        ============================================
        B2N_Valid_VarName (function)
        B2N_SetNcDim      (function)
        B2N_GetNcDim      (function)

        External Subroutines Required:
        ============================================
        CTM_GET_DATA        TAU2YYMMDD    (function)  
        UNDEFINE            REPLACE_TOKEN (function)
        STRREPL (function)  GETMODELANDGRIDINFO
    
 REQUIREMENTS:
        (1) References routines from GAMAP and TOOLS packages.
        (2) You must use a version of IDL containing the NCDF routines.

 NOTES:
        (1) BPCH2NC assumes that each data block in the *.bpch file
            is either 2-D (lon-lat) or 3-D (lon-lat-alt). 

        (2) BPCH2NC assumes that the number type of each data block
            in the *.bpch file is REAL*4 (a.k.a. FLOAT). 

        (3) BPCH2NC assumes that all data blocks in the *.bpch file
            file adhere to same horizontal grid.  This will always
            be true for output files from the GEOS-CHEM model.

        (4) BPCH2NC will write a separate NC file corresponding
            to each time index in the *.bpch file.  This prevents
            file sizes from getting large, especially if there is
            a lot of diagnostic output in the *.bpch file.

        (5) BPCH2NC will replace the %DATE% token with the 
            current YYYYMMDD value, and will replace the %TIME%
            token with the current HHMMSS value.  Therefore, it
            is recommended to insert these tokens into the string
            passed via OUTFILE.  The tokens %DATE% and %TIME% tokens 
            may also be passed in lowercase (e.g,  %date%, %time% ).  

        (6) BPCH2NC will write arrays containing the latitudes,
            longitudes to the netCDF file.  For 3-D data blocks,
            the sigma centers will also be written to the file.  
            Date and time are stored as global attributes.

        (7) The netCDF library has apparently been updated in 
            IDL 6.0+.  The result is that variable names containing
            characters such as '$', '=', and ':' may now cause an
            error in NCDF_VARDEF.  Therefore, we now pre-screen 
            tracer names with function NCDF_VALID_NAME.
           
 EXAMPLE:
        BPCH2NC, 'myfile.bpch', 'myfile.%DATE%.%TIME%.nc'

            ; Will write the contents of "myfile.bpch" to one
            ; or more netCDF files "myfile.YYYYMMDD.HHMMSS.nc"

 NAME:
        CTM_READ_COARDS

 PURPOSE:
        Reads data blocks from a COARDS-compliant netCDF file (such
        as created by routine BPCH2COARDS) into GAMAP.  CTM_READ_COARDS 
        is is an internal routine which is called by CTM_OPEN_FILE.

        NOTE: COARDS is a formatting standard for netCDF files which
        is widely used in both the atmospheric & climate communities.
        COARDS-compliant netCDF files can be read by GAMAP, GrADS and
        other plotting packages.
        
        See http://ferret.wrc.noaa.gov/noaa_coop/coop_cdf_profile.html
        for more information about the COARDS standard.

        FILEINFO -> Array of FILEINFO structures which will be
             returned to CTM_OPEN_FILE.  CTM_OPEN_FILE will 
             append FILEINFO to the GAMAP global common block.

        DATAINFO -> Array of DATAINFO structures (each element 
             specifies a GAMAP data block) which will be returned
             to CTM_OPEN_FILE.  CTM_OPEN_FILE will append FILEINFO 
             to the GAMAP global common block.

            (b) longitude, latitude, levels, time

        (2) Assumes that times are given in GMT.

        (3) If information about each tracer in the COARDS-compliant
            netCDF file is stored in the GAMAP "tracerinfo.dat" file, 
            then CTM_READ_COARDS will be able to read the file without 
            having to ask the user to supply a GAMAP category and
            tracer name.  
       
 EXAMPLE:
        ILUN     = 21
        FILENAME = 'coards.20010101.nc'
        CTM_READ_COARDS, ILUN, FILENAME, FILEINFO, DATAINFO

 NAME:
        CTM_WRITENC

 PURPOSE:
        Save GAMAP datainfo records to disk (in netCDF format)

 CATEGORY:
        GAMAP Utilities, Scientific Data Formats

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        CTM_WRITENC, DATAINFO, FILENAME=FILENAME

 INPUTS:
        DATAINFO -> a datainfo record or an array of datainfo records

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        FILENAME -> Filename of output file. Should end in '.bpch'.

        SCALE -> An optional scaling factor. This factor will be applied 
             to _all_ data record upon saving. The globally stored records
             are not affected.

        NEWUNIT -> With this keyword you can change the unit _name_ for
             the saved data. This will _not_ perform a unit conversion!
             For a true unit conversion you must also use the SCALE
             keyword. NEWUNIT will be applied to _all_ records!

 OUTPUTS:
        A binary punch file with the selected data records will be
        created.

 SUBROUTINES:
        External Subroutines Required:
        ====================================
        CTM_GET_DATA
        OPEN_FILE
        DATATYPE

 REQUIREMENTS:
        Must have a version of IDL w/ the netCDF library installed.

 NOTES:
        This routine forces reading of all selected data records via
        ctm_get_data. This may take a while for huge ASCII punch files.

 EXAMPLE:
        gamap [,options]  ; call gamap to read records from a file
        @gamap_cmn        ; get global datainfo structure
        d = *pglobalDataInfo 
        ind = where(d.tracer eq 2)  ; select all Ox records
        ctm_writebpch,d[ind],filename='oxconc.bpch'

 NAME:
        NCDF_READ

 PURPOSE:
        Open a netCDF file and read data from it. The data is 
        returned as a structure whose tag names are the names of 
        the variables with blanks etc. replaced. If no variables 
        are specified with the VARIABLES keyword, only dimensional 
        information is returned. You can load all variables using
        the ALL keyword. Other keyword options include OFFSET, COUNT, STRIDE,
        NO_DIMENSIONS, NO_STRUCT, DIMNAMES, VARNAMES, VARDIMS, ATTRIBUTES.
        Thus, this program includes ncdump functionality.
        If no filename is given, a file selection dialog is
        opened with the default mask '*.nc'. The name of the selected
        file is returned in the TRUENAME keyword. A file selection
        dialog also appears when the file cannot be found (see
        OPEN_FILE.PRO). This can be turned off with the NO_DIALOG
        keyword. The VERBOSE keyword provides information while
        analyzing and reading the file.

 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O, Scientific Data Formats

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        NCDF_READ, result, filename=<string>, truename=<string>,
            variables=<stringarray>, all=<flag>, varnames=<stringarray>, 
            vardimid=<structure>, vardims=<structure>, attributes=<structure>,
            count=<integerarray>, offset=<integerarray>, stride=<integerarray>, 
            dimnames=<stringarray>, dims=<longarray>, no_dimensions=<flag>,
            no_struct=<flag>, no_dialog=<flag>, verbose=<flag>, title=<string>

 ARGUMENTS:
        RESULT(out) -> a structure containing all the variable data
             from the netCDF file. If only one variable is specified 
             and the NO_STRUCT keyword set, then RESULT will be an
             array instead of a structure. Use the ALL keyword
             to load all variables at once. Note, that the COUNT, OFFSET,
             and STRIDE keywords can affect the size of RESULT.
             RESULT is set to -1L if an error occurs before the structure
             has been built. You can use CHKSTRU.PRO to test for this.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        FILENAME(in) -> the name of the netCDF file to be opened.
             NCDF_READ uses OPEN_FILE to check the validity of
             the file first. You can specify a search mask
             instead of a filename in which case a file selection
             dialog is displayed (unless you set the NO_DIALOG
             keyword). The TRUENAME keyword contains the name
             of the selected file or an empty string if the
             file selection was canceled.

        TRUENAME(out) -> the (fully qualified) name of the file selected
             with the file selection dialog or an unaltered copy
             of FILENAME if FILENAME is a valid filename.

        VARIABLES(in) -> a string array containing the names of variables
             for which data shall be read. Default is to read 
             only the dimensional information from the file. 
             (Currently) no warning is issued if a variable is not in the file.

        ALL(in) -> set this keyword to load all variables stored in the 
             netCDF file. Generally, you cannot usethis keyword together with
             COUNT, OFFSET, and STRIDE.

        VARNAMES(out) -> a string array containing the names of all variables 
             as stored in the file. Note, that the tag names of e.g. the
             result structure are filtered with the Valid_TagName function.
             
        VARDIMID(out) -> a structure with integer arrays containing the 
             dimension ID's for all variables. See also VARDIMS which returns
             the dimensions themselves.

        VARDIMS(out) -> a structure with integer arrays containing the 
             dimensions for all variables in the netCDF file. These are not
             kept in sync with potential COUNT, OFFSET, and STRIDE values,
             but reflect the data sizes as stored in the file.

        ATTRIBUTES(out) -> a structure holding the variable and global
             attributes stored in the netCDF file (global attributes
             are stored in tag name GLOBAL). 

        COUNT(in) -> an integer array containing the number of values to
             be read for each dimension of the variables. Mapping of the
             COUNT dimensions to the variable dimensions is achieved via
             the first entry in the VARIABLES list and the COUNT parameter
             will be applied to all variables that have that dimension. 
             Example: The first variable has dimensions LON, LAT, LEV,
             the second variable has dimensions LON, LAT, and the third
             variable has LAT, LEV. A COUNT of [40,20,10] would lead to
             result dimensions of [40,20,10], [40,20], and [20,10].

        OFFSET(in) -> an integer array containing the offsets for each
             dimension of the variables to be read. Dimension mapping
             is the same as for COUNT.

        STRIDE(in) -> an integer array containing the stride for each
             dimension of the variables to be read. Dimension mapping
             is the same as for COUNT.
             
        DIMNAMES(out) -> a string array containing the names of the 
             dimensions stored in the netCDF file.

        DIMS(out) -> a long array containing the dimension values. Purely
             for convenience. Use VARDIMS to retrieve the dimensions of
             the variables.

        TITLE(in) -> A title for the file selection dialog if an
             incomplete or incorrect filename is specified. This
             keyword is ignored if the no_dialog keyword is set.

        NO_DIMENSIONS(in) -> set this keyword if you do not want to store
             the dimensional variables from the file in the result structure. 
             DIMNAMES and DIMS will still be retrieved.

        NO_STRUCT(in) -> if only one variable is selected with the
             VARIABLE keyword, you can set this keyword to return only
             the data for this variable as an array. This keyword implies
             the functionality of NO_DIMENSIONS.

        NO_DIALOG(in) -> set this keyword if you do not want interactive 
             behaviour when a file mask is given instead of a filename or
             when the specified file does not exist.

        VERBOSE(in) -> set this keyword to get detailed information while
             reading the netCDF file.

 SUBROUTINES:
        Valid_TagName : replaces invalid characters in variable names so that
            a structure can be built.
      
        ncdf_attributes : retrieves global and variable attributes from netcdf
            file and stores them as structure.

        ncdf_dimensions : retrieves size and name for all dimensions in netcdf file.

        ncdf_varnames : retrieves names and dimension information for all variables
            in the netCDF file.

        ncdf_mapdims : map dimension indices for COUNT, OFFSET, and STRIDE with 
            dimensions of first selected variable.

        ncdf_TestDimensions : compute the COUNT, OFFSET, and STRIDE vectors that
            must be applied for retrieving the data of one variable.

 REQUIREMENTS:
        uses OPEN_FILE and STRREPL.

 NOTES:
        Correct handling of dimensional information requires that the variables
        storing the dimension values have the same name as the dimensions
        themselves - a common feature in most netCDF standards.

        I am still working on a netcdf file object which will be even
        more powerful. At some point ncdf_read will only be a
        procedure interface to this objec!

 EXAMPLE:
        ncdf_read,result,/All
        ; plot ozone vs. temperature
        plot,result.temperature,result.ozone

 NAME:
        NCDF_SET

 PURPOSE:
        Convenience routine to write data into netCDF format.

 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O, Scientific Data Formats

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        NCDF_SET, FID, DATA, NAME, DIMS [, Keywords ]

 INPUTS:
        FID -> netCDF File ID, as returned by routine NCDF_CREATE.

        DATA -> Data (array or scalar) to be written to netCDF file.

        NAME -> Name under which the data array will be saved 
             to the netCDF file.  

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        LONGNAME -> Longer descriptive name for the data.  
             This will be saved as the "long_name" attribute.  

        RANGE -> A 2-element vector containing the [min,max] of
             the data array.  If not passed, RANGE will be computed
             (but only if DATA is a numeric type).  RANGE is saved 
             to the netCDF file as the "valid_range" attribute.

        UNIT -> String containing the units of the data. 
             This will be saved as the "unit" attribute.       

        _EXTRA=e -> Picks up extra keywords

 OUTPUTS:
        None

 SUBROUTINES:
        Uses the following routines:
        =====================================================
        NCDF_Control    NCDF_VarDef     (function)
        NCDF_AttPut     DATATYPE        (function from TOOLS)
        NCDF_VarPut     NCDF_VALID_NAME (function from TOOLS)   

 REQUIREMENTS:
        Need to use a version of IDL w/ netCDF routines installed.

 NOTES:
        (1) For now, treat BYTE data like CHAR data.  This is
            most likely since netCDF does not support STRING types,
            strings have to be stored as arrays of bytes.

 EXAMPLE:

        ; Define array to write to file
        ARRAY = DIST( 100, 50 )

        ; Find out if netCDF is supported on this platform
        IF ( NCDF_EXISTS() eq 0 ) then MESSAGE, 'netCDF not supported!'

        ; Open netCDF file and get the file ID # (FID)
        FID = NCDF_CREATE( 'myfile.nc', /CLOBBER )
        IF ( FID lt 0 ) then Message, 'Error opening file!'

        ; Set dimensions for netCDF file
        S    = SIZE( ARRAY, /DIM ) 
        DIM1 = NCDF_DIMDEF( FID, 'Length', S[0] )
        DIM2 = NCDF_DIMDEF( FID, 'Width',  S[1] )

        ; Go into netCDF DATA mode
        NCDF_CONTROL, FID, /ENDEF

        ; Call NCDF_SET to write the array to the file
        NCDF_SET, FID, ARRAY, 'My Data', [ DIM1, DIM2 ], $
                  LONGNAME='Data array created by me!',  $
                  UNIT='unitless'

        ; Close the netCDF file
        NCDF_CLOSE, FID

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:
        bmy, 19 Apr 2002: TOOLS VERSION 1.50
        bmy, 10 Sep 2002: TOOLS VERSION 1.51
                          - Now call routine DATATYPE to determine
                            the type of the data so that we can
                            write to the netCDF file appropriately
                          - Don't add the RANGE attribute to
                            the netCDF file for a string type value.
                          - Updated comments 
        bmy, 21 Oct 2003: TOOLS VERSION 1.53
                          - now "sanitize" the netCDF variable name
                            w/ routine NCDF_VALID_NAME.  The new netCDF
                            library in IDL 6.0+ chokes on bad characters.

 NAME:
        NCDF_VALID_NAME

 PURPOSE:
        Strips invalid characters from a string which is to be
        used as a netCDF variable name.  Based on original code
        by Martin Schultz.

 CATEGORY:
        File & I/O, Scientific Data Formats

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
        RESULT = NCDF_VALID_NAME( ARG )

 INPUTS:
        ARG -> netCDF variable name string to be examined.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        None

 OUTPUTS:
        RESULT -> New netCDF name string with "bad" characters
             replaced by "good" characters.

 SUBROUTINES:
        External Subroutines Used:
        ==========================
        STRREPL (function)

 REQUIREMENTS:
        None

 NOTES:
        In IDL 6.0+, the netCDF library has been updated.  Some
        characters which used to be allowed in netCDF variable names
        are no longer allowed.  Therefore, use this function to
        replace "bad" characters with "good" characters when 
        reading or writing to/from netCDF files.

 EXAMPLE:
        RESULT = NCDF_VALID_NAME( 'IJ-AVG-$::CO' )
        PRINT, RESULT

             ; Prints "IJ-AVG-S__CO"
